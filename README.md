# Identifying MOSIP Data Tap Points
MOSIP ([mosip.io](http://mosip.io)) is a technology platform which helps governments and other organizations implement a digital, foundational identity system in a cost-effective way.

To help explore and understand MOSIP's operational behaviour, this repository will contain code for analysing key data tap points. The approach rests on [simulating user interactions](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/mosip-simulation/) and comparing successive database states. To this end, we provide utility scripts for identifying relevant tables in the MOSIP schema and generating tabular outputs of any data inserted/deleted/updated. Along with tabular schema information, this information is intended to be used in subsequent analysis, for example for statistical modelling.

These repositories are currently private but can be accessed on request. We will be releasing these publicly in due course. For the time being, please request access by opening a new [support issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/mosip-data-extraction/issues).
